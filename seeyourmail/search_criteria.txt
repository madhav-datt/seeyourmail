//  Return all messages.
string allMsgs = "ALL";

//  Search for already-answered emails.
string answered = "ANSWERED";

//  Search for messages on a specific date.
//  The date string is DD-Month-YYYY where Month is
//  Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, or Dec.
string onDate = "SENTON 05-Mar-2007";

//  Search for messages between two dates.  SENTBEFORE
//  finds emails sent before a date, and SENTSINCE finds
//  email sent on or after a date.  The "AND" operation
//  is implied by joining criteria, separated by spaces.
string betweenDates = "SENTSINCE 01-Mar-2007 SENTBEFORE 05-Mar-2007";

//  Another example of AND: find all unanswered emails
//  sent after 04-Mar-2007 with "Problem" in the subject:
string complexSearch1 = "UNANSWERED SENTSINCE 04-Mar-2007 Subject \"Problem\"";

//  Find messages with a specific string in the body:
string bodySearch = "BODY \"problem solved\"";

//  Using OR.  The syntax is OR <criteria1> <criteria2>.
//  The "OR" comes first, followed by each criteria.
//  For example, to match all emails with "Help" or "Question" in the subject.
//  You'll notice that literal strings may be quoted or unquoted.
//  If a literal contains SPACE characters, quote it:
string orSearch = "OR SUBJECT Help SUBJECT Question";

//  Strings are case-insensitive when searching....

//  Find all emails sent from yahoo.com addresses:
string fromSearch = "FROM yahoo.com";
//  Find all emails sent from anyone with "John" in their name:
string johnSearch = "FROM John";

//  Find emails with the RECENT flag set:
string recentSearch = "RECENT";

//  Find emails that don't have the recent flag set:
string notRecentSearch = "NOT RECENT";
//  This is synonymous with "OLD":
string oldSearch = "OLD";

//  Find all emails marked for deletion:
string markedForDeleteSearch = "DELETED";

//  Find all emails having a specified header field with a value
//  containing a substring:
string headerSearch = "HEADER DomainKey-Signature paypal.com";

//  Find any emails having a specific header field.  If the
//  2nd argument to the "HEADER" criteria is an empty string,
//  any email having the header field is returned regardless
//  of the header field's content.
//  Find any emails with a DomainKey-Signature field:
string headerExistsSearch = "HEADER DomainKey-Signature \"\"";

//  Find NEW emails: these are emails that have the RECENT flag
//  set, but not the SEEN flag:
string newSearch = "NEW";

//  Find emails larger than a certain number of bytes:
string sizeLargerSearch = "LARGER 500000";

//  Find emails marked as seen or not already seen:
string seenSearch = "SEEN";
string notSeenSearch = "NOT SEEN";

//  Find emails having a given substring in the TO header field:
string toSearch = "TO support@chilkatsoft.com";
//  A more long-winded way to do the same thing:
string toSearch2 = "HEADER TO support@chilkatsoft.com";

//  Find emails smaller than a size in bytes:
string smallerSearch = "SMALLER 30000";

//  Find emails that have a substring anywhere in the header
//  or body:
string fullSubstringSearch = "TEXT \"Zip Component\"";
